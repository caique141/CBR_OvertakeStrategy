# CBR_OvertakeStrategy

This is a CBR framework applied to autonomous race driving overtake strategy.
Open the simulator and the the desired parameters.
The system will start with the case base in the file CaseBase.mat, this can be changed with other case base in the folder Data.

The simulator start the race positioning the cars at a random location until they complete and overtake. Then it restarts the postition to accelerate the event of overtake and promote it in different locations of the track. 

To generate new overtakes, set the Casegenerator option and run the simulator. Created overtakes need strategy analysis.
